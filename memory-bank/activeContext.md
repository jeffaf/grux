## Current Session Context
Initialized Memory Bank for GRUX project in `/Users/jeffaf/code/grux`.
Updated `projectBrief.md` with project details and Memory Bank information.
Updated `productContext.md` with detailed information on tech feeds, visual styles, and project structure.
Refined project priorities based on user feedback, focusing on core visuals and error handling.

## Current Goals
- Define the detailed component structure within each feature area (terminal, matrix, feeds, animations).
- Plan the implementation steps for the core terminal component using xterm.js.
- Outline the approach for implementing the Matrix rain animation and other visual effects.
- Plan the integration of the HackerNews API for tech feeds.
- Decide on the specific characters (Katakana or ASCII) for the Matrix rain animation.
- Prioritize implementation of core visual elements and error handling.
- De-prioritize display customization, themes (for initial version), user accounts, persistence, feed management, and sound effects.

## Open Questions
- What are the specific commands we want to support in the terminal initially?
- Should the Matrix rain animation use Katakana or ASCII characters? (User preference?)
- What is the desired level of configurability for animation speed and other visual effects (considering customization is now a secondary priority)?
