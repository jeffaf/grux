## Current Session Context
- Implemented comprehensive Matrix rain effect:
  - Created core MatrixRain class with efficient animation system
  - Implemented configurable visual effects and performance optimizations
  - Added idle detection for automatic activation
  - Integrated with terminal commands and controls
  - Updated documentation and progress tracking
- Previous work completed:
  - Initialized project structure and Memory Bank
  - Set up basic terminal functionality with xterm.js
  - Implemented command handling system
  - Created project documentation

## Current Goals
1. HackerNews API Integration:
   - Design API service structure
   - Create feed display component
   - Implement feed-related commands
   - Consider caching strategy
   
2. Terminal Improvements:
   - Add command history navigation
   - Implement tab completion for commands
   - Add error boundaries
   - Enhance terminal configuration options

3. Testing and Optimization:
   - Test matrix rain performance on different devices
   - Optimize render efficiency
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Validate idle detection behavior

## Open Questions
- What HackerNews feed categories should we support?
- Should we cache feed data locally?
- What additional terminal commands would be useful?
- Should we add support for custom command aliases?
- Should the matrix rain animation timing be adjusted based on device performance?
- Would users benefit from additional matrix visual effects?
- What's the optimal idle timeout duration for matrix activation?
- Should we add a configuration file for persistent settings?

## Current Priorities
1. Begin HackerNews API integration
2. Test matrix rain performance across different scenarios
3. Implement command history and tab completion
4. Add error handling improvements

## Notes
- Matrix rain implementation successfully follows the architectural decisions documented
- Idle detection and automatic activation working as expected
- Configuration system allows for future extensions
- Terminal interface remains responsive during matrix animation
