## Current Session Context
- Reviewed xterm.js documentation for advanced features:
  - Parser hooks system capabilities
  - Custom sequence handling
  - Color rendering improvements
- Analyzed terminal enhancement opportunities:
  - Tab completion implementation
  - Color output improvements for hack command
  - Parser hooks integration
- Updated architectural documentation:
  - Enhanced terminal component plan
  - Extended backdoor implementation plan
  - Documented key architectural decisions

## Current Goals
1. Terminal Enhancement Implementation:
   - Add tab completion system
   - Fix color rendering in hack command
   - Implement custom parser hooks
   - Enhance backdoor mode interaction

2. Parser Hooks Integration:
   - Set up custom sequence handlers
   - Implement color management system
   - Add progress indicators
   - Create completion request handling

3. Virtual Environment Improvements:
   - Implement path completion
   - Add command suggestions
   - Enhance visual feedback
   - Improve command output formatting

4. Testing and Documentation:
   - Test parser hooks performance
   - Validate completion system
   - Document custom sequences
   - Update user documentation

## Open Questions
- What completion strategies should be prioritized?
- How to handle completion in different contexts (normal vs backdoor mode)?
- Should we implement fuzzy matching for completion?
- What color schemes should be supported in hack command?
- How to handle parser hook performance on slower devices?
- Should we add animation sequences for certain commands?
- What additional virtual environment features could use custom sequences?
- How to maintain backward compatibility with existing features?

## Current Priorities
1. Implement core parser hooks system
2. Add tab completion framework
3. Fix hack command color rendering
4. Enhance virtual environment integration
5. Test and optimize new features
6. Update documentation with new capabilities

## Notes
- Parser hooks provide powerful extension capabilities
- Tab completion will significantly improve user experience
- Color rendering fixes will enhance visual appeal
- Virtual environment can leverage new features for better realism
- Performance considerations needed for hook implementation
- Documentation needs to be comprehensive for future maintenance

## Recent Decisions
- Implementing tab completion using xterm.js parser hooks
- Creating custom color sequence handling
- Adding completion providers system
- Enhancing virtual environment with new capabilities
- Documenting all custom sequences for maintainability
