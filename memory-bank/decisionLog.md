## [2025-02-18] - Matrix Rain Effect Implementation Strategy

**Context:** Research into matrix rain effect implementations led us to analyze the Rezmason/matrix GitHub repository, which provides extensive insights into creating an authentic and performant matrix rain effect.

**Key Implementation Decisions:**

1. **Rain Effect Core Characteristics:**
   - Grid-based approach: Glyphs will be positioned in a fixed grid
   - Stationary symbols with illumination waves creating the rain effect
   - Multiple raindrops can occupy a single column with different speeds
   - Sawtooth wave pattern for raindrop progression

2. **Visual Elements:**
   - Color: Use classic green phosphor (#33ff33) with proper glow effect
   - Glyph cycling: Implement symbol changes in falling characters
   - Cursor/tracer effect at bottom of each raindrop
   - Brightness variation between characters

3. **Implementation Approach for xterm.js:**
   - Use terminal grid cells as our matrix grid
   - Implement custom character set using xterm.js character support
   - Utilize xterm.js cursor positioning for efficient updates
   - Take advantage of bright and normal ANSI green colors for glow effect
   - Use terminal's built-in cursor for the "tracer" effect

4. **Customization Parameters:**
   - Animation speed
   - Fall speed
   - Symbol change rate
   - Column density
   - Glow intensity

5. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Buffer updates to minimize terminal renders
   - Optimize grid calculations
   - Use efficient data structures for tracking raindrops
   - Implement frame rate limiting to prevent terminal overload

**Rationale:**
- The grid-based approach with stationary symbols matches xterm.js's character grid nature
- Using terminal native features (cursor, colors) ensures better performance
- Customization parameters allow for future tweaking and user preferences
- Performance considerations are crucial for smooth terminal operation

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create core rain effect module in `/src/features/matrix`
2. Implement basic grid and raindrop management
3. Add glow and color effects using xterm.js capabilities
4. Integrate with terminal idle detection
5. Add customization options through terminal commands

**Impact:**
- This approach allows us to maintain the authentic Matrix look while working within terminal constraints
- Performance optimizations ensure smooth operation alongside other terminal features
- Customization options provide flexibility for future enhancements

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
1. Canvas-based implementation: Rejected due to integration complexity with xterm.js
2. Pure CSS animation: Rejected due to limited control and performance concerns
3. Web component: Rejected to maintain terminal-first approach

**Dependencies:**
- xterm.js terminal capabilities
- Terminal color support
- Performance characteristics of the host system

**Future Considerations:**
- Potential for additional visual effects (ripples, glitches)
- Mobile device performance optimization
- Theme variation support
