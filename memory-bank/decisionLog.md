# Architectural Decision Log

## Terminal Directory Handling Review (2024-02-20)

### Context
During terminal enhancement review, a concern was raised about directory tracking in backdoor mode and its reflection in the prompt.

### Investigation Results
- VirtualLinuxEnvironment correctly tracks current working directory (cwd)
- Directory changes are properly reflected in:
  - Internal cwd state
  - PWD environment variable
  - Path resolution for commands
  - Prompt generation using PS1 format

### Decision
Maintain current directory tracking implementation but enhance feedback and visibility:
- Add visual feedback for directory changes
- Ensure immediate prompt updates
- Consider adding directory status to terminal title
- Implement PWD caching for performance

### Rationale
- Current implementation is architecturally sound
- Improvements focus on user feedback rather than core functionality
- Enhanced visibility will improve user experience

## Terminal Enhancements (2024-02-19)

### Tab Completion Implementation
**Context:** The terminal needs better interactivity and user experience, particularly in backdoor mode.

**Decision:** Implement tab completion using xterm.js parser hooks and a dedicated completion system.

**Rationale:**
- Improves user experience by reducing typing needed
- Makes the backdoor mode feel more like a real Linux environment
- xterm.js parser hooks provide a clean way to implement this feature

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use custom DCS sequences for completion requests
- Implement multiple completion providers (commands, paths, options)
- Cache completion results for better performance

### Color Output Enhancement
**Context:** The hack command's color output isn't rendering properly, affecting the visual experience.

**Decision:** Implement custom CSI sequences for color handling using xterm.js parser hooks.

**Rationale:**
- Better control over color rendering
- More consistent visual experience
- Support for advanced color effects in hack commands

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create custom CSI handler for color sequences
- Implement color utilities for consistent usage
- Support 256-color mode for rich output

### Parser Hooks Integration
**Context:** Need to extend terminal functionality beyond basic features.

**Decision:** Implement comprehensive parser hooks system for custom sequences.

**Rationale:**
- Enables advanced terminal features
- Provides framework for future extensions
- Better control over terminal behavior

**Technical Details:**
- Custom sequences for:
  - Tab completion
  - Color rendering
  - Progress indicators
  - System status
- Integration with VirtualLinuxEnvironment

### Impact Analysis
**Positive Impacts:**
- Enhanced user experience
- More realistic terminal emulation
- Better visual feedback
- Framework for future features

**Potential Risks:**
- Performance overhead from hooks
- Complexity in sequence handling
- Backward compatibility concerns

**Mitigation:**
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Careful testing of sequence handling
- Maintain fallback behavior

### Next Steps
1. Implement core parser hooks
2. Add tab completion system
3. Enhance color handling
4. Update documentation
5. Performance testing
6. User feedback collection

This decision log will be updated as implementation progresses and new architectural decisions are made.

## Build Error Resolution (2025-04-07)

### Context
Build failure detected in VirtualLinuxEnvironment.ts due to truncated implementation.

### Investigation Results
- File missing critical methods defined in backdoorPlan.md:
  - execCommand
  - getCompletions
  - resolvePath
  - getEnv/setEnv
  - formatOutput
- Missing class closing brace causing build failure

### Decision
Restore complete implementation according to backdoorPlan.md specifications.

### Rationale
- Original implementation aligned with architectural decisions
- Missing methods are essential for terminal functionality
- Implementation details already specified in backdoorPlan.md

### Impact
- Restoring functionality will fix build error
- No architectural changes needed, just implementation restoration
- All previously planned features remain valid
