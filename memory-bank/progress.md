# Project Progress

## Completed Work

### Project Setup & Initial Implementation
- âœ… Initialized project structure and Memory Bank
- âœ… Set up basic React application
- âœ… Installed core dependencies (react, xterm.js)
- âœ… Created initial project documentation
- âœ… Implemented basic terminal functionality
- âœ… Set up command handling system
- âœ… Implemented basic terminal styling

### Matrix Rain Effect Implementation
- âœ… Created matrix feature module structure
- âœ… Implemented core MatrixRain class with:

  - Raindrop tracking
  - Animation loop
  - Terminal rendering integration
- âœ… Added visual effects:
  - Glow effect using terminal colors
  - Character cycling
  - Cursor/tracer effects
- âœ… Implemented performance optimizations:
  - Animation frame-based rendering
  - Efficient grid updates
  - Smart character management
- âœ… Added configuration options:
  - Animation speed
  - Fall speed
  - Density settings
  - Glow intensity
- âœ… Integrated idle detection for automatic activation
- âœ… Added matrix control commands

## In Progress
- ðŸ”„ HackerNews API Integration
  - Setting up API service
  - Creating feed display component
  - Adding feed-related commands

## Next Steps

### HackerNews Integration
1. Set up API service
2. Create feed display component
3. Implement feed-related commands

### Terminal Enhancements
1. Add command history navigation
2. Implement tab completion
3. Add error boundaries
4. Create configuration system

### Matrix Rain Enhancements
1. Add more visual effects:
   - Ripple effects on input
   - Color variations
   - Speed variations based on terminal size
2. Optimize performance for different devices
3. Add more configuration options

## Upcoming Features
- Command history
- Tab completion
- Error handling improvements
- Terminal configuration options
- Feed caching system (if decided)

## Known Issues
None currently tracked

## Performance Considerations
- Monitor terminal render performance
- Track animation frame rates
- Test on different devices/browsers

## Notes
- Matrix rain effect successfully implemented with configurable parameters
- Idle detection working as expected
- Need to test performance on different devices
- Consider adding more visual effects in the future
- May need to adjust idle timeout based on user feedback
