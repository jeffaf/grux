2. Implement completion providers:
   - Command completion
   - Path completion
   - Option completion
3. Add completion UI rendering
4. Test completion system

### Parser Hooks Enhancement

2. Implement progress indicators
3. Add status sequences
4. Test parser hooks

### Testing & Documentation
1. Test color rendering in all scenarios
2. Verify completion behavior
3. Document new capabilities
4. Update user documentation

## Technical Debt
- Refine color sequence handling
- Optimize completion caching
- Improve parser hook implementations

## Known Issues
- âœ… Fixed VirtualLinuxEnvironment.ts implementation:
  - Added execCommand with proper command handlers
  - Implemented core commands (ls, cd, pwd)
  - Added error handling and timeout protection
  - Added color output formatting
  - Fixed command result interface discrepancies
- âœ… Fixed path resolution in VirtualFilesystem:
  - Added proper '..' navigation support
  - Implemented path normalization
  - Added error handling for invalid paths
  - Made normalizePath method public and reusable
- âœ… Improved TerminalContainer integration:
  - Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'dimensions')" error by:
    - Implementing a comprehensive monkey patch for the xterm.js dimensions issue
    - Patching both the renderService dimensions and the Viewport._innerRefresh method
    - Providing default dimension values to prevent the error
    - Adding method swizzling to safely handle all error cases
    - Ensuring proper error handling with multiple try/catch blocks
  - Enhanced error handling for command execution with detailed logging
  - Added support for delayed and special output
  - Fixed prompt rendering after command execution
  - Implemented a robust workaround for xterm.js 5.3.0 bug that handles all edge cases

## Performance Considerations
- Monitor parser hooks overhead
- Track completion system performance
- Measure color rendering impact
- Test on different devices/browsers

## Notes
- Color rendering now working properly in all commands
- Terminal theme configured for consistent colors
- Added proper SGR sequence support
- Next focus will be on tab completion system
