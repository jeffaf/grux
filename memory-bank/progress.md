# Project Progress - GRUX

## Work Done
- Created `memory-bank` directory in `/Users/jeffaf/code/grux`.
- Initialized core Memory Bank files:
    - `productContext.md`: Defined project vision, goals, constraints, and Memory Bank file descriptions.
    - `activeContext.md`: Documented current session context and initial goals.
    - `decisionLog.md`: Documented Memory Bank initialization decision.
- Updated `projectBrief.md` with detailed project information and Memory Bank section.
- Updated `productContext.md` with detailed information on tech feeds, visual styles, and project structure based on user clarifications.
- Updated `activeContext.md` to reflect the clarified details and refined current goals and open questions.
- Updated `productContext.md` to reflect refined project priorities, emphasizing core visuals and error handling, and de-prioritizing other features.
- Updated `activeContext.md` to align with the refined priorities.

## Next Steps
- Define the detailed component structure within each feature area (terminal, matrix, feeds, animations).
- Plan the implementation steps for the core terminal component using xterm.js.
- Outline the approach for implementing the Matrix rain animation and other visual effects.
- Plan the integration of the HackerNews API for tech feeds.
- Decide on the specific characters (Katakana or ASCII) for the Matrix rain animation.
- Prioritize implementation of core visual elements and error handling.
